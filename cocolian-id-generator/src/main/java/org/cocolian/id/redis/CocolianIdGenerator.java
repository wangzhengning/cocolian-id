/**
 * Generates IDs using Redis that have strong guarantees of k-ordering, and include a timestamp that can be considered
 * issued by a time oracle so long as time is kept in check on the Redis instances used.
 *
 * This allows events to be generated in a distributed fashion, stored in a immutable data-store, and a fetch to
 * reconstruct time ordering at any point in the future with strong guarantees that the order is the intended one.
 *
 * We are generating an ID that will be comprised of the following:
 *
 * 41 bit time + 10 bit logical shard id + 12 bit sequence id
 *
 * Note this adds up to 63 bits, because the MSB is reserved in some languages and we value interoperability.
